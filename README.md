Bacon
=====

A Minecraft mod that adds bacon drops to Minecraft. Raw bacon is dropped by pigs, which can be made into cooked bacon by using a furnace.

This version is for Minecraft 1.6.4. It was created using Pahimar's Eclipse development environment setup. A tutorial vid can be found at the following address. I plan on updating it for 1.7.2 and 1.7.10 in the near future.

8/22/15 - I will no longer be developing mods for 1.6.4 at this time. Anyone is welcome to use the code here for any purpose they wish. I look forward to adding more mods for MC 1.7.2, 1.7.10, and 1.8 in the future. As usual, all code will be available on GitHub :)
