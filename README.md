Bacon
=====

A Minecraft mod that adds bacon drops to Minecraft. Raw bacon is dropped by pigs, which can be made into cooked bacon by using a furnace.

This version is for Minecraft 1.6.4. It was created using Pahimar's Eclipse development environment setup. A tutorial vid can be found at the following address. I plan on updating it for 1.7.2 and 1.7.10 in the near future.
